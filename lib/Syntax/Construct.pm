=head1 NAME

Syntax::Construct - Identify which non-feature constructs are used in the code.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.11

=head1 SYNOPSIS

For some new syntactic constructs, there is the L<feature> pragma. For
the rest, there is B<Syntax::Construct>.

  use Syntax::Construct qw( // ... /r );

  my $x = shift // 'default';
  my $y = $x =~ s/de(fault)/$1/r;
  if ($y =~ /^fault/) {
      ...
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a simple way of specifying syntactic constructs
that are not implemented via the L<feature> pragma, but are still not
compatible with older versions of Perl.

=head1 EXPORT

Nothing. Using B<Syntax::Construct> with no parameters is an error,
giving it an empty list is a no-op.
